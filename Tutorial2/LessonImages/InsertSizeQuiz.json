                "feedback": "Incorrect. Remember that nucleosomes include 145 bp of DNA wrapped around histones. Fragments less than this size likely correspond to nucleosome free regions."

                "feedback": "Close, but while nucleosomes consist of 145 bp of DNA, the insertion by Tn5 a short distance from nucleosomes provides a range of insert values starting at 145 and extending further. Choose the appropriate size range using the graph shown at the start of this module."

                "feedback": "Correct. While nucleosomes consist of 145 bp of DNA, the insertion by Tn5 provides a slightly larger size range. Using the above graph, we can pick the appropriate range."

                "feedback": "Nucleosomes consist of 145 bp of DNA, thefore 300-500 bp insert sizes typically correspond to di-nucleosomes."
